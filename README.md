Getting and Cleaning Data Project


SmartLab ran an experiment where they had subjects go through a series of tests wearing a Samsung Galaxy SII in their hip.

They have released the raw and processed data from these experiments; however, the data is not in easily understandable neither in  useable form. This project converts the data into two separate tidy datasets:

    tidy-dataset.txt contains the mean and standard deviation of each measurement for all subjects and tests.

To download and tidy the data, simply run the run_analysis.R script.
